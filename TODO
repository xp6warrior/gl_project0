1. Finalise camera methods
    ++ setLookPosition to modify m_yaw and m_pitch
    ++ float instead of vec3 arguements
    - more local axis methods?
    - normalise the camOffset vector

2. Finalise functionality of renderer and camera
    - renderer contains view and projection matrix, camera simply modifies them
    - renderer can work without camera -> requires some default view matrix

3. Figure out constructors for all objects
    - give more options (default, some parameters, all parameters...)

4. Polish up shader programs
    - every object needs its own instance of a shaderProgram (EACH WITH DIFFERENT PROGRAM ID)
    - shared resources for copies of the same object
    - look into materials (how other engines do it)
    - better input structure

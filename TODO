1. Remove dependency libraries from header files
    - think of alternatives for glm in headers
    - change from PUBLIC to PRIVATE in CMakeLists.txt

2. Finalise functionality of renderer and camera
    - renderer contains view and projection matrix, camera simply modifies them
    - renderer can work without camera -> requires some default view matrix

3. Figure out constructors for all objects
    - give more options (default, some parameters, all parameters...)

4. Polish up shader programs
    - every object needs its own instance of a shaderProgram (EACH WITH DIFFERENT PROGRAM ID)
    - shared resources for copies of the same object
    - look into materials (how other engines do it)
    - better input structure
